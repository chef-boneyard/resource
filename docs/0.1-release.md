# Crazytown 0.1

Crazytown is an attempt to make Chef resources easier and more fun to write and use, as well as more powerful.  The 0.1 version aims to:

- Remove barriers to writing resources (define anywhere, remove ceremony, simplify concepts).
- Make the right thing to do the easy thing to do (automatic idempotence, dry run, little green text)
- Allow users to customize resources in-place (defaults, extension, renaming)
- Make resources usable as APIs (let them write *and* read).
- Let resources adapt more to their users (flexible type system).

# Resources: Where You Define Them

## Define Anywhere

One bit of friction that you have to overcome to create a resource: if you are only using a resource in one place, you need to go off and create a recipe file.  Crazytown eliminates this by letting you create resource types *anywhere*.  `libraries`, `resources` or even in a recipe!

While this may not be something you *always* want to do, it's a *great* way to write and test your resource, is awesome for tutorials (single file), and good for learning (file structure one less distracting thing to learn; you will still want to learn it, but this lets you learn one thing at a time).

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
#
# bank/recipes/default.rb
Crazytown.resource :bank_account do
  attribute :account_id, String, name_attribute: true
  attribute :full_name, String
  attribute :balance, Numeric

  recipe do
    HTTP.put("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/#{account_id}", "#{full_name} #{balance}")
  end

  def load
    parts = HTTP.get("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/#{account_id}").split(' ')
    full_name parts[0]
    balance parts[1]
  end
end

bank_account 'jkeiser' do
  full_name 'John 5. Keiser'
  balance '$1,000,000'
end
```

It can be done with current resources, but not very practically: you have to learn how to declare classes, learning about the proper base classes, and some ceremony to get it up and hacked and working.

## Resource Defaults

The purpose of resources is to make it so that users don't have to type the same thing over and over.  Just about everyone who has created files and directories will sympathize with this: mode, owner and group need to be retyped each time.  Crazytown introduces a new `defaults` mechanism to allow people to make specialized versions of a resource (or even renames) that have those values as their initial value.

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
Crazytown.defaults :superuser_file, :file, mode: 0700, owner: 'root', group: 'wheel'

# This gets created with mode 700, owner root and group wheel
superuser_file '/x.txt' do
  content 'hi'
end
```

## Single File Resources (No Providers)

Currently, you need to create two files, or two classes, in order to make a single resource.  The second class is called a *provider*.  This is, frankly, the place where most people trip up.  Let's for example this, shall we?  We're going to make a resource that will put and get your bank account balance like this:

```ruby
bank_account 'jkeiser' do
  full_name 'John A. Keiser'
  balance '1000000'
end
```

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
#
# bank/resources/account.rb
attribute :account_id, index: true
attribute :full_name
attribute :balance
recipe do
  HTTP.put("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/#{account_id}", "#{full_name} #{balance}")
end
```

### The Current Way

```ruby
#
# bank/resources/account.rb
attribute :account_id, name_attribute: true
attribute :full_name
attribute :balance
default_action :create


#
# bank/providers/account.rb
action :create do
  HTTP.put("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/#{new_resource.account_id}", "#{new_resource.full_name} #{new_resource.balance}")
end
```

Already we've reduced the cognitive load:

- We removed the entire concept of a provider
- We reduced the number of context switches (the user doesn't have to create multiple things)
- We replaced the `action` concept with `recipe` (something the user already knows)
- We didn't have to introduce the concept of `new_resource` (ceremony that gets in the way of reading the code)
- We didn't have to introduce member access (users generally haven't typed this yet when they first wrote recipes)
- The user did not have to start thinking about multiple actions yet

## Resource Definitions (define)

Full-on resources are super useful, and allow you to create reusable things that can both read and write; but sometimes you don't need quite so much.  Sometimes you're really just writing a recipe with nice attributes.  In these cases, Crazytown merges the best of the `definition` and `resource` worlds to give you the simplest resource possible, removing the need even for the word `recipe`:

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
Crazytown.define :apache, config_dir: '/etc/httpd' do
  package 'apache2' do
  end
  file "#{config_dir}/httpd.conf" do
    content "awesome config"
  end
  service 'apache' do
    action :start
  end
end

apache 'yay' do
  config_dir '/etc/httpd2'
end
```

### The Current Way

```ruby
define :apache, config_dir: '/etc/httpd' do
  package 'apache2' do
  end
  file "#{config_dir}/httpd.conf" do
    content "awesome config"
  end
  service 'apache' do
    action :start
  end
end
```

Identical syntax here ... the differences are semantic:

The differences:
- Defineable inline (which is important)
- Creates real resources
- Nests resources under parent, making relationships clear
- Removes user confusion due to existing definitions being "macros" where the word "apache" never even shows up in the list of resources

# Resources: How They Work

## Patchiness

In general, Chef resources are *patchy*.  This means that if you specify only some attributes, the other attributes don't get blanked out: they stay the same (or in some cases get set to a default).  A canonical example: if you say this:

```ruby
file 'x.txt' do
  mode 0666
end
```

It does *not* mean you want the file's `content` to disappear.  Our resource has a huge issue here.  If you don't to specify your bank balance, it will be emptied out!

```ruby
bank_account 'jkeiser' do
  full_name 'John Z. Keiser'
  # Uh oh, my balance is about to go nil
end
```

Crazytown makes patchiness natural and easy with a new rule:

> The default value of an attribute is its *current value* (if you don't say anything about an attribute, you don't want it to change).

Implementing this is easy in Crazytown: you add a `load` recipe:

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
#
# bank/resources/account.rb
attribute :account_id, index: true
attribute :full_name
attribute :balance

recipe do
  HTTP.put("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/#{account_id}", "#{full_name} #{balance}")
end

def load
  parts = HTTP.get("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/#{account_id}").split(' ')
  full_name parts[0]
  balance parts[1].to_f
end
```

### The Current Way

```ruby
# bank/resources/account.rb
attribute :account_id, name_attribute: true
attribute :full_name
attribute :balance
default_action :create

# bank/providers/account.rb
action :create do
  full_name = new_resource.full_name || @current_resource.full_name
  balance = new_resource.balance || @current_resource.balance
  HTTP.put(account_id, "#{full_name} #{balance}")
end

def load_current_resource
  @current_resource = Chef::Resource::BankAccount.new(account_id)
  parts = HTTP.get("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/#{new_resource.account_id}").split
  @current_resource.full_name parts[0]
  @current_resource.balance parts[1].to_f
end
```

We have reduced several points of cognitive load here:

- You don't need to introduce a new variable (current resource)
- You don't need to learn about class variables (@current_resource)
- Ceremony is again reduced (no prefacing things with @current_resource)
- You don't need to think about whether the user set full_name and balance (handled automatically)

## Read API

Another issue with resources is their usability for other purposes.  Specifically, you sometimes need to read the value of a resource during a recipe.  With Providers, the current resource is out of reach (it won't even exist until you load the provider).  When you spend so much time implementing `load_current_resource`, it's frustrating.

By pulling `load_current_resource` into the resource and setting the default value of the resource's attributes to their current value, Crazytown has in effect created both a write *and* a read API.  You don't even have to modify anything.  Here's some code that uses the resource we just built:

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
combined_balance = bank_account('jkeiser').balance.to_f + bank_account('mkeiser').balance.to_f

file '/Users/jkeiser/budget.txt' do
  content "Balance: #{combined_balance}"
end
```

### Current Resources

```ruby
combined_balance =
  HTTP.get("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/jkeiser").split(' ')[1].to_f +
  HTTP.get("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/mkeiser").split(' ')[1].to_f

file '/Users/jkeiser/budget.txt' do
  content "Balance: #{combined_balance}"
end
```

We've saved a few things here:
- We don't have to implement the logic twice (keep it in one place, think about it once)
- We don't have learn that we *have* to implement the logic twice (a difficult task in itself right now)

## Resource Inheritance

It can sometimes be useful to say "I want this resource to be like this other one, but with a few extra things."  Crazytown resources are built to be inheritance, from the declaration syntax on down.  Type `resource :name, Superclass do ... end` to declare one.

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
resource :chef_object do
  attribute :chef_server_url, default: "https://api.opscode.com"
  attribute :organization, String
  attribute :name, String, identity: true
  attribute :raw_data, String, default: lazy { calc_raw_data }
  def calc_raw_data
    { organization: organization, name: name }
  end
  def url
    "#{chef_server_url}/organizations/#{organization}/#{name}"
  end
  def load
    raw_data JSON.parse(HTTP.get(url))
  end
  recipe do
    converge do
      HTTP.post(url, JSON.to_json(raw_data))
    end
  end
end

resource :chef_user, ChefObject do
  attribute :public_key
  def calc_raw_data
    { **super, public_key: public_key }
  end
  def load
    super
    public_key raw_data['public_key']
  end
end

resource :chef_data_bag, ChefObject

resource :chef_role, ChefObject do
  attribute :run_list
  def calc_raw_data
    { **super, run_list: run_list }
  end
  def load
    super
    run_list raw_data['run_list']
  end
end
```

## Lazy Values (and do blocks)

Because of Chef's two-phase "compile the recipes, then run them" model, lazy values are a key component of using Chef resources.  Both existing resources and Crazytown resources and Crazytown resources support them.  Crazytown introduces some more compact syntax, as well as a conceptual optimization for lazy defaults.

### The Crazytown Way

First, we'll talk about the lazy default.  Given a budget resource that looks like this:

```ruby
Crazytown.resource :budget do
  attribute :account_id, String, identity: true
  attribute :salary, Numeric
  attribute :spending_money, Numeric do
    default { salary / 12 }
  end
end
```

The lazy default will yield this:

```ruby
budget 'jkeiser' do
  salary 1200
  puts spending_money # 100 per month!  Soooo much ramen!
end
```

Additionally, a normal lazy value can be written similarly:

```ruby
budget 'jkeiser' do
  salary 12000000
  spending_money { (bank_account(account_id).balance + salary) / 12 * 0.5 }
end
```

TODO make attr { } do default
TODO if we are calculating an explicit lazy value for an attribute, and it asks for the value of that attribute, either *error* or get the current/default value?  That would allow spending_money { spending_money*0.5 } to have a useful meaning.
TODO if you try to read a value in a compile-tim context and it fails due to nonexistence, error out (require that it be protected by a resource_exists?, which will not have that same issue).

### The Current Way

The same lazy default in the current world would look like this:

```ruby
attribute :spending_money, default: lazy { |budget| budget.salary / 12 }
```

And the explicit lazy value would look like this:

```ruby
budget 'jkeiser' do
  salary 12000000
  spending_money lazy { (bank_account(account_id).balance + salary) / 12 * 0.5 }
end
```

The big differences:
- The word `lazy` isn't generally necessary, making things a bit easier to read.  (And given that we're introducing a new, much easier way to write code that *reads* data, lazy values are likely to become more common that they presently are.)
- Lazy defaults are run in the instance, so you don't have to use member access and preface everything with an explicit value.  (This can be turned off if you're super into multi-argument functions.)

## Composition (resources as attributes)

Because attributes can have types in Crazytown, that means attributes can have Resource types as well.  This concept is deeply embedded and resource references are easy to construct and use.  Witness:

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
Crazytown.resource :budget do
  attribute :account, BankAccount, identity: true
  attribute :joint_account, BankAccount
  attribute :salary, Numeric
  attribute :spending_money, Numeric do
    default { salary / 12 }
  end
end

budget 'jkeiser' do
  joint_account 'keisers'
  salary 1000000
  spending_money { account.balance / 12 + joint_account.balance / 12 }
end
```

This allows you to do three things:
- Make attributes with the type of other resources
- Easily construct references to other resources (just by specifying the identity values)--`budget 'jkeiser'` and `joint_account 'keisers'` above both do that.
- Easily reference those resources (and their real values) with member access syntax

## Inline Resources (recipe do)

Crazytown is designed to minimize the number of steps a user has to take before they can write a resource.  Many starting Chef users know resources and recipes, but do not know Ruby.  Crazytown makes the leap simple by treating the resource "action" as a `recipe` (and by using that terminology consistently to define it).

This means everything you know about recipes transfers: you can make resources, and they execute entirely the same way.

LWRPs already allow this; Crazytown just moves it up a notch and reduces the friction between you and your resource.

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
resource :apache do
  attribute :config_dir, String
  recipe do
    package 'apache2' do
    end
    file config_dir do
      content "awesome config"
    end
    service 'apache' do
      action :start
    end
  end
end
```

### The Current Way

```ruby
#
# resources/apache.rb
attribute :config_dir, String, default: '/etc/httpd'
default_action :create

#
# providers/apache.rb
use_inline_resources true

action :create do
  package 'apache2' do
  end
  file "#{config_dir}/httpd.conf" do
    content "awesome config"
  end
  service 'apache' do
    action :start
  end
end
```

The main differences here (on top of the many benefits already described, such as single-file resources) are:
- Removes the need for `action`
- Removes the need to turn it on at all: `use_inline_resources true`

## Compound Resources (load_value and converge :field)

There are some features that are designed to make things easier down the road, too.  Certain resources are *compound resources*--that is, they have multiple attributes, and those attributes correspond to different actual things (some of which may take a long time to access).  `file` is one of those--`content` and `mode` are read and written in completely different ways, and `content` can be expensive to access, in particular (reading an entire file).

Crazytown offers a way to keep the power of lazy loading and load / converge these attributes separately: `load_value` and `converge`.  To wit, here's a sample `file` resource:

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
resource :file do
  attribute :path, String, identity: true
  attribute :mode, Fixnum
  attribute :content, String, load_value: lazy { IO.read(file) }
  def load
    return resource_exists(false) if !File.exist?(path)
    mode File.stat(path).mode
  end
  recipe do
    # Only run if mode is set and is different from real value
    converge :mode do
      File.chmod(mode, path)
    end
    # Only run if content is set and is different from real value
    converge :content do
      IO.write(path, content)
    end
  end
end
```

### The Current Way

```ruby
#
# foo/resources/file.rb
attribute :path, name_attribute: true
attribute :mode
attribute :content

#
# foo/providers/file.rb
def load_current_resource
  if File.exist?(new_resource.path)
    @current_resource = Chef::Resource::FooFile.new(new_resource.path)
    # Only load content and mode if the user wants to change them
    if !new_resource.mode.nil?
      @current_resource.mode File.stat(new_resource.path).mode
    end
    if !new_resource.content.nil?
      @current_resource.content IO.read(new_resource.path)
    end
  end
end

action :create do
  if (!@current_resource && new_resource.mode) || (new_resource.mode != @current_resource.mode)
    converge_by "Change mode of #{new_resource.path} to #{new_resource.mode}" do
      File.chmod(new_resource.mode, new_resource.path)
    end
  end
  if (!@current_resource && new_resource.content) || new_resource.content != @current_resource.content
    converge_by "Write #{new_resource.content} to #{new_resource.path}" do
      IO.write(new_resource.path, new_resource.content)
    end
  end
end
```

Differences:
- You no longer have to explicitly check whether the user set values--this happens automatically.
- Eliminates conceptual trickiness with "does the resource exist" interacting with "did the user set this value" and "is the user's value different from the resource's value".  Rigorous thought around this is not everyone's (most people's) cup of tea and takes a lot of experience to get down pat.
- Works for read as well as write

# Type System

## Strong Types

One problem here: if the user types invalid input, we'd like the recipe to fail instead of screwing up our account balance.  To wit:

```ruby
bank_account 'jkeiser' do
  full_name 'John L. Keiser'
  balance 'one MEEEEEELLION dollars'
end
```

The new and old ways of doing this aren't that different--one word of ceremony less.  Here's how they work:

### The Crazytown Way

To do this, we assign our attributes strong types.  

```ruby
#
# bank/resources/account.rb
attribute :account_id, String, index: true
attribute :full_name, String
attribute :balance, Numeric
...
```

Crazytown defines automatic coercion from strings for `Integer`, `Boolean`, and `Symbol`, and automatic coercion to `String` with `to_s`, but you can define your own coercion as well.  We'll talk about that more in the coercion section.

### The Current Way

```ruby
# bank/resources/account.rb
attribute :account_id, kind_of: [ String ], name_attribute: true
attribute :full_name, kind_of: [ String ]
attribute :balance, kind_of: [ Numeric ]
```

The reduction isn't large here, but the removal of `kind_of` does have a real effect.
- The type feels like an intrinsic part of the attribute rather than optional, making it more likely people will write types.

Because it's intrinsic and not wrapped in a `kind_of`, a type can now indicate some other things, like coercion and printing.

## Primitive Coercion

An additional problem is, if the user types something actually invalid, we'd like the program to fail and tell us this:

```ruby
bank_account 'jkeiser' do
  full_name 'John L. Keiser'
  balance 'one MEEEEEELLION dollars'
end
```

### The Crazytown Way

Crazytown doesn't change at all except to remove the .to_f:

```ruby
#
# bank/resources/account.rb
...
def load
  parts = HTTP.get("https://myswissbankaccount.com/api/#{account_id}").split(' ')
  full_name parts[0]
  balance parts[1] # <-- no more to_f
end
```

### The Current Way

Current resources have a bit more to do:

```ruby
# bank/resources/account.rb
attribute :account_id, kind_of: [ String ], name_attribute: true
attribute :full_name, kind_of: [ String ]
attribute :balance, kind_of: [ Numeric ]
def account_id(value=nil)
  value = value.to_f if value
  super
end
def account_id=(value)
  account_id(value)
end
def balance(value=nil)
  value = value.to_f if value
  super
end
def balance=(value)
  balance(value)
end
...
```

The difference here:
- You don't have to implement coercion for common types

## Custom Coercion

Another thing we may want to do is allow the user to input balances in other ways: for example, with a dollar sign:

```ruby
bank_account 'jkeiser' do
  full_name 'John P. Keiser'
  balance '$1,000,000'
end
```

### The Crazytown Way

In Crazytown, we implement this by specializing the Crazytown Type for Numeric and adding our own coercion:

```ruby
type :currency, Numeric do
  def self.coerce(value)
    value = value.to_f if value && !value.is_a?(Numeric)
    super
  end
end

attribute :account_id, String, name_attribute: true
attribute :full_name, String
attribute :balance, Currency
...
```

#### Alternative Crazytown: Doing It Inline

We could also have done the same thing inline if we thought we'd never need to use the type again:

```ruby
attribute :account_id, String, name_attribute: true
attribute :full_name, String
attribute :balance, Numeric do
  def self.coerce(value)
    value = value.to_f if value && !value.is_a?(Numeric)
    super
  end
end
...
```

In Crazytown, `do` on an `attribute` or `resource` puts you into the `class` definition for the thing in question.  In this case, the main way (defining Currency) makes more sense.

### The Current Way

```ruby
attribute :account_id, kind_of: [ String ], name_attribute: true
attribute :full_name, kind_of: [ String ]
attribute :balance, kind_of: [ Numeric ]
def account_id(value=nil)
  value.replace(/[$,]/, '') if value.is_a?(String)
  value = value.to_f if value && !value.is_a?(Numeric)
  super
end
def account_id=(value)
  account_id(value)
end
def balance(value=nil)
  value = value.to_f if value
  super
end
def balance=(value)
  balance(value)
end
...
```

Because we had added this to the previous example, we didn't have to change much here.  If you were doing coercion as your first thing, you'd have to learn everything from the Strong Types example, but nothing more.  For Crazytown, type coercion is where you have to learn the new thing.

The main changes:
- You only have to deal with the value, not multiple getter/setter methods: `def self.coerce(value)` (instead of `balance(value=nil) and `balance=(value))
- The coercion can be made super readable by creating a custom type

## Value Printing

When the system prints out the value of the balance, it prints a number that's not the easiest to read.  For example, when we call `to_text`, the resource looks like this:

```
bank_account[jkeiser]
  - full_name: John U. Keiser
  - balance: 1000000
```

Let's get it to look like this:

```
bank_account[jkeiser]
  - full_name: John U. Keiser
  - balance: $1,000,000
```

### The Crazytown Way

In Crazytown, we modify our currency type:

```ruby
type :currency, Numeric do
  def self.value_to_s(value)
    with_commas = value.to_s.reverse.gsub(/(\d{3})(?=\d)/, '\\1,').reverse
    puts "$#{with_commas}"
  end
  ...
end
...
```

The current system doesn't have support for this.  You can override `to_text`, but you have to write a *lot* more code than you would probably like to, that way.

## Resource References

Crazytown supports resource references as a first-class concept as well!  Just declare the attribute to have the Resource as its type.

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
resource :person do
  attribute :spouse, Spouse
end
```

## Automatic Freezing

Crazytown freezes values (makes them readonly) once they have been defined, to allow for the copying and precalculation of values where desired.  It freezes identity values after the resource is declared, so that notifications cannot be thrown off; it freezes *all* values after the do block.

```ruby
f = file '/x/y.txt' do
  path '/z/abc.txt' # FAILS.  You can't change the reference after construction
  content 'hi'
end

...

f.content 'something else' # FAILS.  You can't change the desired value after definition.
```

TODO might want to only ever freeze all or none, due to optional identity attributes that users might want to *set* during the `do` block.  Have to think about this more.

# Identity and Construction

Crazytown formalizes the concept of **identity** of a resource:

> A resource's **identity** is the information the identifies it; i.e. all the information necessary to look it up.

You've seen this, but it bears repeating.

## Resource Construction

Identity values are used for something more than just looking up data.  They are used in *resource construction*.  There are two scenarios where this comes up: when you create a new resource, and when you initialize a resource property on another resource.

### The Crazytown Way

This example shows both:

```ruby
resource :bank_account do
  attribute :account_id, String, identity: true
  attribute :linked_account, BankAccount
  attribute :full_name, String
  attribute :balance, Numeric
end

bank_account 'jkeiser' do
  linked_account 'mkeiser'
  puts linked_account.balance # shows mkeiser's account balance
end
bank_account 'mkeiser' do
  linked_account 'jkeiser'
  puts linked_account.balance # shows mkeiser's account balance
end
```

## Compound Identity

Many resources have multiple bits of data that make up their true identity.  Witness, for example, Chef's data bag item: its unique identification consists of both the data bag name, and the data bag item name.  Crazytown allows for this.

### The Crazytown Way

```ruby
resource :data_bag do
  attribute :data_bag_name, String, identity: true
  attribute :data_bag_item_name, String, identity: true
end

data_bag 'bag', 'item' do
  ...
end
```

## Alternate Identities (Optional Values)

Even types with a natural key also often have a "primary key," and users may sometimes want to specify one, and sometimes specify the other.  Resources have a way to specify all these keys and pick them during load.  Take, for example, a google map location: it could be specified by GPS, by google_place_id, or by street address.

### The Crazytown Way

In Crazytown, you can mark identity attributes as optional with default values:

```ruby
Crazytown.resource :google_place do
  attribute :place_id,   Integer, identity: true, default: nil
  attribute :latitude,   Numeric, identity: true, default: nil
  attribute :longitude,  Numeric, identity: true, default: nil
  attribute :address,    Address, identity: true

  attribute :place_name, String

  def load
    if place_id
      place = GooglePlaceSDK.get_by_id(place_id)
    elsif address
      place = GooglePlaceSDK.get_by_address(address)
    else
      place = GooglePlaceSDK.get_by_long_lat(latitude, longitude)
    end
    place_id   place.place_id
    latitude   place.latitude
    longitude  place.longitude
    address    place.address
    place_name place.place_name
  end

  recipe do
    converge do
      GooglePlaceSDK.save(to_h)
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, we see not only three distinct groups of IDs (place_id, address, latitude/longitude), but also the `load` code which loads in the *other* bits of ID.  When a resource is constructed this way, you can initialize it multiple ways:

```ruby
google_place place_id: 14901234931 do
  place_name 'Butters and Breads'
end

google_place longitude: 123.456, longitude: 65.4321 do
  place_name 'Tonka Burgers'
end

google_place address: '123 Main St, Seattle, WA 98021, USA' do
  place_name 'Black Mesa'
end
```

And you can read data from it:

```ruby
place = google_place(address: '123 Main St., Seattle, WA 98021, USA')
puts place.latitude
puts place.longitude
```

There isn't really a way to do anything like this currently in Chef resources.

*Referencing* such an object is interesting. currently these resources would have names like:

```
google_place[google_place_id:11243123]
google_place[latitude:123.1239,longitude:22.234523]
google_place[address:1 Main St.,Seattle,WA,98045,USA]
```

In general, though, it would be nice to be able to say "I subscribe to an update on object X" and .  This is called the *canonicalization* of the resource reference, and is the subject of a future update.  For now, you have to specify resource references exactly the way they are defined.

### Empty Constructor

Optional values leave open the possibility of the *empty constructor*, which simply sets all identity values to their default.  In the above example, that wasn't a real thing, but there are cases where you might want to.  Witness, for example, a resource that manages the list of organizations and users in Github:

```ruby
resource :chef_server do
  attribute :url, Uri, identity: true, default: "https://api.opscode.com"
  attribute :organizations, load_value: lazy { HTTP.get("#{url}/organizations") }
end

puts github.organizations # empty constructor initializes the URL to its default
```

## Resource As Identity

In a number of cases, one resource is actually a part of the identity of another resource.  When that happens, Crazytown strives to make it as painless as possible to construct and use the resource.

### The Crazytown Way

Here's how it looks:

```ruby
resource :bank do
  attribute :bank_name, String, identity: true
  attribute :routing_number, String
end

resource :bank_account do
  attribute :bank, Bank, identity: true
  attribute :account_id, Integer, identity: true
  attribute :description, String
end

bank_account 'Bank Of America', 23947823948 do
  description 'My Account'
end
```

## Custom Resource Construction

One issue with the previous example is that with all attributes optional, you always have to specify name/value pairs to construct the resource; even if you can figure it out.  Crazytown's resource system has a very easy way around this: redefine the `open` method on the resource!  The default `open` method (on the base class) is the one that decides the default way of constructing the resource.

### The Crazytown Way

In Crazytown, you replace the `coerce` method:

```ruby
Crazytown.resource :google_place do
  attribute :place_id,  Integer, identity: true, default: nil
  attribute :latitude,  Numeric, identity: true, default: nil
  attribute :longitude, Numeric, identity: true, default: nil
  attribute :address,   Address, identity: true

  # We support:
  # google_place 234243242 (place id)
  # google_place 235.123, 44.12 (lat/long)
  # google_place '123 SE 102nd St., Seattle, WA 98045' (address)
  def self.coerce(*args, **named)
    if args.size == 1
      if args[0].is_a?(Integer)
        super(place_id: args[0], **named)
      else
        super(address: args[0], **named)
      end
    elsif args.size == 2
      super(latitude: args[0], longitude: args[1], **named)
    else
	  super(*args, **named)
	end
  end
end
```

## Resource Construction Algorithm

The algorithm for deciding how the identity attributes will look is:

1. Any required (non-defaulted) identity attributes may be passed as positional arguments to the constructor:
```ruby
resource :foo do
  attribute :a, identity: true
  attribute :b, identity: true
  attribute :c, identity: true
  attribute :child, Foo
end
foo 1, 2, 3 do
  puts a # 1
  puts b # 2
  puts c # 3
  child 4, 5, 6
end
```
2. *All* identity attributes, whether they are identity or not, can be specified with keyword arguments:
```ruby
resource :foo do
  attribute :a, identity: true
  attribute :b, identity: true
  attribute :c, identity: true
  attribute :d, identity: true, default: 'ddd'
  attribute :e, identity: true, default: 'eee'
  attribute :f, identity: true, default: 'fff'
  attribute :child, Foo
end
foo 1, 2, 3, d: 4, f: 6 do
  puts a # 1
  puts b # 2
  puts c # 3
  puts d # 4
  puts e # eee
  puts f # 6
  child 2, 3, 4, d: 5, e: 6, f: 7
end

foo a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, f: 6 do
  puts a # 1
  puts b # 2
  puts c # 3
  puts d # ddd
  puts e # eee
  puts f # 6
end

# Any combination of positinal and keyword arguments is also acceptable.
foo 1, 2, c: 3 do
puts a # 1
puts b # 2
puts c # 3
puts d # ddd
puts e # eee
puts f # fff
end
```

3. If required identity attributes are not passed or are passed both positionally and as keyword arguments, an error is thrown.

# The Future

In the future, we hope to implement:

- Recipes and Resources
  - Reference syntax for compound identity
    - Reference syntax: resource_type[a,b,identity3:a,identity4:b]
    - `subscribes 'bank_account[Bank Of America,293874239874]'`
    - Canonicalization for identity since there are multiple ways to construct
      resources with a single identity
      ```ruby
      bank_account 'Bank of America', 923848237423 do
      end
      file 'changed' do
        # These are all the same:
        subscribes 'bank_account[Bank of America,923848237423]'
        subscribes 'bank_account[Bank of America,account_number:923848237423]'
        subscribes 'bank_account[12398423,923848237423]'
        subscribes 'bank_account[bank_name:Bank of America,account_number:923848237423]'
        subscribes 'bank_account[routing_number:12398423,923848237423]'
      end
      ```
    - Decide what to do with `name` and whether any resource can have an
      arbitrary name
  - Nested resources
    - Resource types can have *contained* (child) resource types
      ```ruby
      resource :bank do
        attribute :bank_name, String
        attribute :description, String
        resource :account do
          attribute :id, Integer, identity: true
          attribute :balance, Fixnum
        end
      end
      ```
    - Resources can be declared from their parents and access parent variables
      ```ruby
      bank 'Bank of America' do
        account 923848237423 do
          balance 1000000
        end
        account 125234978234 do
          balance 999999
        end
      end
      ```
    - Resources can be usefully used outside the model
      ```ruby
      boa = bank 'Bank of America'
      boa.account 923848237423 do
        balance 1000000
      end
      ```
    - Resources can access their parent resources
      ```ruby
      bank 'Bank of America' do
        # Automatically grabs "bank"
        account 923848237423 do
        end
      end
      ```
    - Nested reference syntax: resource[...].resource[...]
      `bank[Bank of America].account[923848237423]`
    - Make it possible to make sub-resources a *model* (the sub-resources are
      actually properties of the resource, and all that implies for order of
      operations, dependencies, etc.)

  - Nested recipes (bake the LWRP model deeper into the system)
    - Recipes are resources (and thus can access their parents)
    - Unclear how these should be referenced.  Probably if you actually type
      `recipe`, resources inside said recipe would be at the parent level.  But
      if you create a resource, resources declared inside that resource's recipes
      would be at the resource level (outer[blah].inner[blah]).
    - A resource either *is* or *has* a recipe
    - Possibly bring "converge do" to the top level of the resource, turning
      the resource into a recipe and making it clearer that recipe construction
      is about constructing a series of resources--not about a linear set of
      instructions.

  - Context-specific resources ("I want 'machine' to mean *this* but only in my
    cookbook/recipe/callstack")

  - Recipe execution models
    - Immediate-mode recipes (compile resources but not their definitions,
      making resources referenceable).  If this were the default, it would let
      forward references fail early.
      - Identity is frozen when the `do` block begins (this already happens and
        this is the purpose of it)
    - Super-immediate-mode recipes (don't compile anything until recipe run,
      making it impossible to reference the resources)
    - Parallel-mode recipes (resources are referenceable)
    - Incremental-mode recipes (converges that can do as much as possible and
      then pause until a notification occurs).  Can be done for immediate,
      parallel and two-phase recipes
- Deeper Type System
  - nested struct types
  - safe, coercing, lazy arrays, sets, and hashes
  - inheritable values (direct struct/hash/array specialization via `base_resource`)
- Common Library Resources
  - common patterns for Path, DataSource (files), TreeDataSource (directories),
    Transforms
  - common transforms for JSON, XML, .rb
  - common sources for file, directory, http, https
  - common mirror algorithm that works on any pair of TreeDataSources (take from
    ChefFS)
  - Easy, common credentials and configuration for any URL
- Chef in Chef
  - instantiable Chef::Config, logger
  - multiple Chef runs in parallel with different config
  - Chef profiles
  - use resources for Chef::Config
  - ohai as resources
  - chef-provisioning
  - cheffish
  - ChefFS
  - generic command line tools to manipulate chef, machines, etc. using resources
    (knife v2)
